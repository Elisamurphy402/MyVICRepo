# MyVICrepo
The repository to access the VIC project
I am an SQA analyst working on the VIC project and I like to learn how to link up to the VIC GitHub.
I am adding some information to the project, where are the defects going to be pull from?

i AM STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS TOOL IS GOING TO WORK FOR TESTING PROCESSES.

created a new branch will see if I screwed up this whole thing.
